Gaming mouse development kit

This repository contains KiCAD files related to a gaming mouse development kit. The kit contains two controllers used for the left hand and right hand use. Both the LH and RH mouse are connected to a host via USB for USB HID control for game play via a PC or gaming console.

I plan to develop this into a single hand gaming mouse that allows gamers and makers interested to learn embedded microcontrollers, human-interface devices (HID), USB communication protocols, and how to write a USB device driver so that you can develop a USB HID gaming controller or gaming mouse.

This mouse makes use of quality components from PixArt for the optical sensor, input switches from Keihl (Kaihui of China), and considers ergonomics research of the input controller device to make it comfortable for hours of gaming use.

More updates pending as I will modify this project for an easy to use gaming mouse development kit where you can learn about embedded systems and build a practical real-world device you can design, build, use and enjoy.
